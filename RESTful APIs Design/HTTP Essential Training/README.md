### **HTTP Principles**

- Plan language and Human readable
    - GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, CONNECT, etc
- Stateless Protocol
    - Doesn't remember the previous request
- Stateless but not sessionless
- Works based on *request-response pairs*

### HTTP Terminologies

- *Browser:* Application used to access and navigate between HTML documents.
- *User-agent:* Application acting on behalf of the user. Example - browser.
- *TCP:* Transmission Control Protocol, one of the main protocols used by WWW, FTP Server, and Email.
- *IP:* Internet Protocol. IP is used to actually transfer data between computers over a network.
- *URL:* Uniform Resource Locator. An address pointing at a resource on the web.
- *DNS:* Domain name server, DNS Catalogs all domain name URLs and points them to the IP addresses of the servers.
- *Resource:* The file or files available on a server when following a URL.
- *Server:* Computer on the Internet.
- *Proxy:* Acting as middleware between clients and servers.
- *Request-response pairs:* Client and server communicate over HTTP using request-response pairs.
- *Header:* Request and response use HTTP headers to pass information back and forth
- *HTTP Methods:* GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- *Cache:* Method for storing data on the client/server to speed up performance.
- *Cookie:* String of data passed back and forth between client and server to create a state full session.
- *Session:* Clients and servers can share information about states by passing a session.
