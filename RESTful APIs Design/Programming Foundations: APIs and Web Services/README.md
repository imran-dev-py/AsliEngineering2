## [Programming Foundations: APIs and Web Services](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-apis-and-web-services) with Kesha Williams

**Web Service Types**

- RESTful - HTTP to access protocol.
- SOAP - Send a message using XML.

**Advantages**

- Reusability
- Language Transparency
- Usability
- Deployability

Latency - The time it takes a request to return a response..

Partial failure - When a server or network fails to respond.

**API Security**

- Authentication - Validates the Identity of the Client
- Authorization - Determines the level of the Client's access.
- API authentication - Required the API to access unique key basic Auth

Web service is dependent on SOAP which isn't lightweight but RESTapi lightweight

**RESTapi is a set of guidelines to design an API**

4 Principles of APIs

- URI - Universal Resource Identifier
- Operations
    - GET - retrieves a resource
    - PUT - updates a resource
    - POST - creates a resource
    - DELETE - remove a resource
- Formats
    - HTML
    - XML
    - Plain Text
- Stateless - Don't remember previous client request

**Payload - data sent between client and server**

HATEOMAS - Hypermedia as the engine of application state

GraphQL is a query language for API.
